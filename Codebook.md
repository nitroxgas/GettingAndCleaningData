 The data linked to this exercice represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
 As a request to completition of this work, a final dataset should be created containing information regarding the averange values of the means and activities and subject
 
 The run_analysis.R script do the following:
 * First it reads to the R environment all the data from the test and training directories, as well all the labels and informations about the activities and subjects.
 * It assign lables and descriptive names to the variables in the environment;
 * Exclude from the tables all unessesary data, keeping only variables with means and standart deviations;
 * Merges trainning and tests data in a single dataset;
 * Uses ddply and colMeans to calculate the means to each variable, grouped by activitie and subject;
 * Adds a descriptive name to the activity;
 * Writes the final tidy data to the file;
 * Cleans the environment;
 
 The final data set are composed by the means of the variables from the train and test data, grouped by type of activity and the subject:
 typeactivity idsubject tBodyAcc-mean()-X tBodyAcc-mean()-Y tBodyAcc-mean()-Z  ...
1      WALKING         1         0.2773308       -0.01738382        -0.1111481 ...
2      WALKING         2         0.2764266       -0.01859492        -0.1055004 ...

The generated file contains the data set, separated by spaces and with a header.
